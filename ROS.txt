Info for MINT:

----
We need the build essential
sudo apt-get install build-essential -y
----

Basically replace $DISTRIB_CODENAME by 'trusty'. It is because the $DISTRIB_CODENAME for mint 17 is 'qiana' for which its 404 error.

-------------------
$ sudo sh -c '. /etc/lsb-release && echo "deb http://mirror.umd.edu/packages.ros.org/ros/ubuntu trusty main" > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ros-latest.list'

CMakeLists.txt
find_package <- build dependency
catkin_package <- run dependency

------
To run something:
1. Start ros master:
roscore
2. then:
./script
or
rosrun pkg_name script_name
----

rostopic echo /topic_name

----
Publish something on a topic

rostopic pub /topic_name msg_type
----
Publish every 10hz
rostopic pub/topic_name msg_type "data: 'msg'" -r 10
----
Naming convention:
small_letters_with_underscores
----
Graphic tool to see the node graph
rosrun rqt_graph rqt_graph
----
Every import has to be in cmakelist and package.xml
----
NodeInfoQuery.srv
first line: server
second line: client
----
Sleep time difference:
while loop with sleep(0.1)
loop time is sleep time + processing time

r = rospy.Rate(10)
r.sleep()
loop time is always 10 Hz
if processing time is > loop time:
will try to sync it (e.g. sleep 0.2s, processing 0.3)
will sleep for 0.4 s total
----
roslaunch:
pkg = pkg
name = node name // will overwrite the name from the script
type = script

remap to make the connections instead of hardcoding it
always remap subscriber, not publisher

launch lots of node (and start roscore in the process, but do it separately):
roslaunch pkg_name launch_file
